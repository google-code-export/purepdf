#summary What is PdfLayerMembership and how to use it
#labels Phase-Implementation

= Introduction =

With PdfLayerMembership you can provide optional contents to a pdf document. PdfLayerMembership can be used like a PdfLayer, so you can draw everything you want in it.<br />
With PdfLayerMembership you assign members ( other PdfLayer(s) ) and a visibilityPolicy. <br/>
visibilityPolicy can be one of these PdfLayerMembership public constants: *ALLON*, *ALLOFF*, *ANYON*, *ANYOFF*.<br/>
In this way, once the visibility policy is satisfied the PdfLayerMembership instance will be visible, otherwise it will remains invisible into the pdf document.


= Details =

Take this example code:
{{{
var dog: PdfLayer = new PdfLayer("Layer 1", writer);
var tiger: PdfLayer = new PdfLayer("Layer 2", writer);
var lion: PdfLayer = new PdfLayer("Layer 3", writer);


var no_cat: PdfLayerMembership = new PdfLayerMembership( writer );
no_cat.addMember( tiger );
no_cat.addMember( lion );
no_cat.visibilityPolicy = PdfLayerMembership.ALLOFF;
}}}

In this example, the *no_cat* layer will be visible into the pdf document only once both *tiger* and *lion* layers will be set invisible ( for instance by the user who is reading the document )
